### Plan:
1. **Understand the Current Structure**:
   - Review the contents of `wordle.js`, `wordle.html`, `wordle.css`, and `index.html` to understand how the Wordle game is currently implemented.

2. **Identify Potential Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding features such as:
     - A scoring system to track the number of attempts.
     - A timer to limit the time for each game.
     - Improved user interface elements for better user experience.

3. **File Modifications**:
   - **`wordle.js`**: 
     - Implement the scoring system and timer logic.
   - **`wordle.html`**: 
     - Add new elements to display the score and timer.
   - **`wordle.css`**: 
     - Style the new elements for consistency with the existing design.
   - **`index.html`**: 
     - Ensure the start button redirects correctly to the game page.

4. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, thoroughly test the game to ensure all features work as intended.

5. **User Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from users to identify any additional improvements or bugs.
